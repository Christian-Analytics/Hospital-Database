# Hospital-Database
Welcome to the Hospital Database Repository! This project showcases a comprehensive database system designed for managing and organizing hospital-related data efficiently. The repository includes detailed documentation of the database schema and a collection of example queries to interact with the data. This project aims to demonstrate my skills in database design, SQL, and data management within a healthcare context.

Key Components:

Database Design Documentation: Detailed descriptions of the tables and relationships within the database with a narrative provided, entity relationship diagrams, relational schema, and a data dictionary. 
1) Please view the DBDD folder in the repository for the database design documentation.

Query Examples: A set of 8 SQL queries to demonstrate common operations and reports.

2) Please view the Queries folder in the repository for a SQL document with example queries.

Views, SPROCs and Trigger: Data file contains 10 views for commonly accessible data, 14 unique stored procedures (denoted as _SPROC) / Parametric SPROCs (denoted as _PARA), and 1 trigger.

3) Please load the master data and log data file (under the MDF_and_LDF folder in the repository) into SQL Server to view created Views (under the Views folder), Stored Procedures with parameters (under the Programmability folder and the Stored Procedures subfolder), and a Data Definition Language Trigger.

Features:

Database Schema: Detailed documentation of tables for patients, staff, medical supplies, treatments, and billing.

Query Collection: A variety of SQL queries to showcase data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting capabilities.

Data Examples: Example datasets already loaded into the data file for easy testing.
